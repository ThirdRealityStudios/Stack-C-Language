# Stack implemented in C
self-explaining, mostly one base topic of every computer science class or study.

Additionally, I added test functions to prove the functionality (may not be required by your class but it ensures good implementation quality in general).
The code documentation is in German, so yeah.. I don't know why I write this README in English?!
